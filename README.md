Download and run the .mlapp (or .m) file in Matlab. Some Apps need some other dependent additional files.

## SinewaveTimeFreq
View a sine wave in time and frequency domain.

## CombineSinewave

Combine (add) multiple sine waves. View the result in time and frequency domian.

## FourierAnalysis
Create some standard periodic signal using Fourier series. See the effect of adding more harmonics, in time and frequency domain.

## AudioTimeFreq
Record audio, and view the recording in time and frequency domain.

## DTMF 

DTMF tones are composed to 2 pure sine waves. This app shows the time and frewquency view of tones produced by the digits and symbols of a telephone keypad.

## AnalogModulation
Amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) of a tone.

## Multipath 

View multipath interference from delayed signals.

## Digital Modulation

Modulate a data string using ASK, PSK and FSK. View the corresonding spectrum.

## DSSS

Visualize Spreading in Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)

## PolarPlot
Plot trigonotetric equations in a polar diagram. Sample equations are provided.
